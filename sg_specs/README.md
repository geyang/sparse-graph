The sparse graph implementation in this repository makes the assumption that the graph is non-directional, therefore the weighted edges would embed the graph on a Riemann manifold, where the geodesics coincide with shortest-path-distances on the graph. We force a projection from this manifold to an $\ell^p$ sub manifold, by forcing the value function to take the form of $V(g, g') = \Vert \varphi(g) - \varphi(g') \Vert_p$, where $\varphi$ is an embedding.

If the graph are directional, or the value function is not factoried into an embedding function and an $\ell^p$ metric, then this implementation would have to compute the pairwise distance matrix without using the cached latent vectors. This is not necessarily that slow.Â
